> **Note**: This is a personal fork of [KittenML/KittenTTS](https://github.com/KittenML/KittenTTS) with additional features including a Gradio web interface for easy testing.

## üéµ Sample Audio

Here's a sample of what KittenTTS can generate:

**Text**: "Welcome to the future of AI-powered speech synthesis!"
**Voice**: expr-voice-5-f (Female voice)
**Speed**: 1.0x

> üí° **Tip**: Click the link above to play the audio in your browser, or right-click and "Save As" to download the WAV file.

*Note: The audio file demonstrates the natural-sounding speech quality achievable with just 15 million parameters.*

## ‚ú® Features

- **Ultra-lightweight**: Model size less than 25MB
- **CPU-optimized**: Runs without GPU on any device
- **High-quality voices**: Several premium voice options available
- **Fast inference**: Optimized for real-time speech synthesis


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```
pip install https://github.com/KittenML/KittenTTS/releases/download/0.1/kittentts-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```



 ### Basic Usage

```
from kittentts import KittenTTS
m = KittenTTS("KittenML/kitten-tts-nano-0.1")

audio = m.generate("This high quality TTS model works without a GPU", voice='expr-voice-2-f' )

# available_voices : [  'expr-voice-2-m', 'expr-voice-2-f', 'expr-voice-3-m', 'expr-voice-3-f',  'expr-voice-4-m', 'expr-voice-4-f', 'expr-voice-5-m', 'expr-voice-5-f' ]

# Save the audio
import soundfile as sf
sf.write('output.wav', audio, 24000)

```

## üîå API Usage

You can also use KittenTTS via the Gradio API when the web interface is running. This is perfect for integrating TTS into your applications programmatically.

### API Example

First, make sure the Gradio web interface is running:
```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

Then use the API client:

```python
from gradio_client import Client
import shutil
import os

# Connect to the running Gradio app
client = Client("http://localhost:7860/")

# Generate speech via API
result = client.predict(
    text="Welcome to the future of AI-powered speech synthesis!",
    voice="expr-voice-5-f",  # Choose from available voices
    speed=1,  # Speed from 0.5 to 2.0
    api_name="/generate_speech"
)

# Save the generated audio to current directory
if result:
    print(f"Raw result: {result}")

    # Handle tuple result - extract file path
    if isinstance(result, tuple):
        audio_file_path = result[0]
    else:
        audio_file_path = result

    # Copy to current directory with descriptive name
    original_filename = os.path.basename(audio_file_path)
    current_dir_filename = f"generated_speech_{original_filename}"
    shutil.copy2(audio_file_path, current_dir_filename)

    print(f"Audio saved to: {current_dir_filename}")
else:
    print("No audio file generated")
```

### Available API Parameters
- **text**: The text to synthesize (string)
- **voice**: Voice selection from: `expr-voice-2-m`, `expr-voice-2-f`, `expr-voice-3-m`, `expr-voice-3-f`, `expr-voice-4-m`, `expr-voice-4-f`, `expr-voice-5-m`, `expr-voice-5-f`
- **speed**: Speech speed (float, 0.5 to 2.0)

## üåê Web Interface

We've added a simple Gradio webapp for easy testing and experimentation with KittenTTS!

### Features
- üé≠ **Voice Selection**: Choose from 8 available voices (male/female variants)
- ‚ö° **Speed Control**: Adjust speech speed from 0.5x to 2.0x
- üìù **Easy Text Input**: Multi-line text input with example texts
- üîä **Audio Output**: High-quality 24kHz audio generation
- üí° **Example Texts**: Pre-loaded examples to get started quickly

### Running the Web Interface

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akashjss/KittenTTS.git
   cd KittenTTS
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   pip install gradio
   pip install gradio_client # To use the TTS via Gradio API
   ```

3. **Launch the webapp**:
   ```bash
   python gradio_app.py
   ```

4. **Open in browser**: Navigate to http://localhost:7860

The webapp provides an intuitive interface where you can:
- Type or paste text to synthesize
- Select from 8 different voice options
- Adjust speech speed with a slider
- Generate and download audio files
- Try example texts to get started

## üíª System Requirements
