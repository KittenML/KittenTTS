## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from kittentts import KittenTTS
import numpy as np

# Load model
model = KittenTTS("KittenML/kitten-tts-nano-0.1")

# Generate audio
text = "Welcome to the future of text-to-speech! KittenTTS is absolutely incredible - it's fast, lightweight, and produces crystal clear audio quality. This revolutionary AI model is changing the game with just 15 million parameters. Amazing technology!"
audio = model.generate(text, voice='expr-voice-5-m')

# Save audio
audio_normalized = np.int16(audio * 32767)

# Create output folder
import os
os.makedirs('output', exist_ok=True)

with open('output/output.wav', 'wb') as f:
    # WAV header and data writing code...
    pass

print("✅ Audio file created: output/output.wav")
```

### Available Voices

- `expr-voice-2-m` - Male voice 2
- `expr-voice-2-f` - Female voice 2  
- `expr-voice-3-m` - Male voice 3
- `expr-voice-3-f` - Female voice 3
- `expr-voice-4-m` - Male voice 4
- `expr-voice-4-f` - Female voice 4
- `expr-voice-5-m` - Male voice 5
- `expr-voice-5-f` - Female voice 5

## 📁 Files

- `final_example.py` - Complete working example with multiple voices
- `simple_example.py` - Basic usage example
- `output/` - Generated audio files folder (not tracked in Git)

> **Note:** The `output/` directory is gitignored by default. Generated audio files are stored here but not committed to the repository to keep it lightweight. Make sure to back up any important audio files separately.

## 🎯 Examples

### Different voices
```python
for voice in ['expr-voice-5-m', 'expr-voice-5-f']:
    audio = model.generate(text, voice=voice)
    # Save audio...
```

### Speed control
```python
# Normal speed
audio_normal = model.generate(text, voice='expr-voice-5-m', speed=1.0)

# Faster
audio_fast = model.generate(text, voice='expr-voice-5-m', speed=1.5)

# Slower
audio_slow = model.generate(text, voice='expr-voice-5-m', speed=0.7)
```

## 💻 System Requirements

Works literally everywhere - just needs Python 3.8+ and the required dependencies.

## 📊 Audio Specifications

- **Sample rate**: 24000 Hz
- **Format**: WAV (16-bit PCM)
- **Quality**: High-quality professional voice synthesis

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Check Python version:** Python 3.8+ required
